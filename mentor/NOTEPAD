   [Description]

Edit Profile:
  * Create an UpdateView
  * Allow users to edit Avatar and Bio.

  Note: This will be difficult because, in order to view a user's profile, you
  must first find the User from the slug, then override the get_object method
  to retrieve the correct UserProfile object. (You can see this in your 
  UserProfileView model.

  You will have to find a way to:
    1. Retrieve the proper UserProfile model
    2. Pass this into the Update View
    3. Do so whilst including the correct fields. (This is your sticking point.)
    
  SideNote: Add a max file size for profile pictures
